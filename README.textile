h1. Enki

A ruby on rails blogging app for the fashionable developer.

Preferences are for the masses. Any real coder knows the easiest and best way to customize something is by hacking code. Because you want your blog to be you, not bog standard install #4958 with 20 posts per page instead of 15. For this you need a clean, simple, easy to understand code base that stays out of your way. No liquid drops and templates hindering your path, no ugly PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) stylings burning your eyeballs.

h2. Quick Start

<pre><code>
  git clone git://github.com/xaviershay/enki.git enki
  cd enki
  git checkout -b myblog # Create a new work branch
  cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
  # Edit config/enki.yml and config/database.yml to taste
  rake db:migrate
  rake spec
  ./script/server
  # Load http://localhost:3000/admin in your browser
</code></pre>

h2. More info

Enki is a compact, easily extendable base for your blog. It does this by being highly opinionated, for example:

* Public facing views should adhere to standards (XHTML(eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language), Atom)
* /yyyy/mm/dd/post-title is a good URL for your posts
* Live comment preview should be provided by default
* Google does search better than you or I
* You don't need a plugin system when you've got decent source control
* If you're not using OpenID you're a chump
* Hacking code is the easiest way to customize something
